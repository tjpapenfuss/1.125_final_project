Welcome to my project for 1.125 Architecting and Engineering Software Systems. 

In this project, I use terraform to generate AWS infrastructure. THe diagram is listed below:



Once I have the AWS infrastructure setup, I utilize dbt to build my data models. 
All data modeling can be found in the /dbt_local_build/ folder.
